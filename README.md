# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MarinHure
## ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently looking for an end-of-studies internship as Data Scientist, Machine/Deep Learning Engineer

I am an engineering student, specialized in Big Data, I have experience in NLP and Computer Vision.

I had the chance to work on several Data Science project through my studies and internships, you can find some of them in my profile.

Being passionate about sports, particularly rugby, i have discovered Machine Learning working on a project to try and predict the outcomes of rugby matches during the 6 Nations 2023 tournament : 
- [Rugby Predictor Repository](https://github.com/MarinHure/Rugby_Predictor.git)

Here is a school project, using Machine Learning to improve the detection of RFID chips on a conveyer belt :
