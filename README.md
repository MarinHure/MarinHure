# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MarinHure
## ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently looking for an end-of-studies internship as Data Scientist, Machine/Deep Learning Engineer

I am an engineering student, specialized in Big Data, with experience in NLP and Computer Vision.

I have had the opportunity to work on several Data Science projects throughout my studies and internships, and you can find some of them in my profile.

One of my recent projects involves blob detection, where I developed a tool for automatically detecting and simulating networks created by the Physarum polycephalum (blob) from images. 
I utilized computer vision and deep learning techniques for object detection:

- [Blob Detectron Repository](https://github.com/MarinHure/Blob_Detectron.git)

Being passionate about sports, particularly rugby, I discovered Machine Learning while working on a project to predict the outcomes of rugby matches during the 6 Nations 2023 tournament.
I employed machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions:

- [Rugby Predictor Repository](https://github.com/MarinHure/Rugby_Predictor.git)

Here is a school project in which I used Machine Learning to improve the detection of RFID chips on a conveyor belt.
I developed predictive models to enhance chip detection efficiency:

- [RFID Predictive Modelling Repository](https://github.com/MarinHure/RFID_Predictive_Modelling.git)

Feel free to explore these projects, and if you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out! 
You can contact me via email at [marin.hure@gmail.com] or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marin-hure/).
